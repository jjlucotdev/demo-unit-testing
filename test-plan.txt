        - Verify that the text of the navbar brand is "Shazada".
     3. Test Case 3: Page navbar should have at least 3 anchor tags
        - Confirm that the navigation bar contains at least three anchor tags.
     4. Test Case 4: Navbar tags include Home, Products, and About
        - Validate that the navigation bar contains links to Home, Products, and About sections.
     5. Test Case 5: Page navbar background color is rgb(13, 110, 253)
        - Ensure that the background color of the navigation bar matches the specified RGB value.

   - Styling and Layout:

     6. Test Case 6: Page contains a heading with text "Contact Us"

        - Confirm that the element containing "Contact" text is either an h1, h2, or h3 heading.

   - Links and Forms:
     8. Test Case 8: Page has link to Facebook
        - Ensure that there is a link to Facebook on the contact page.
     9. Test Case 9: Page has link to LinkedIn
        - Verify the presence of a link to LinkedIn on the contact page.
     10. Test Case 10: Page has a contact form
         - Confirm the existence of at least one contact form on the page.
     11. Test Case 11: Page has a contact form text input
         - Validate the presence of text input fields within the contact form.
     12. Test Case 12: Page has a contact form email input
         - Ensure the availability of email input fields in the contact form.
     13. Test Case 13: Page has a contact form textarea
         - Confirm the presence of a textarea element within the contact form.
     14. Test Case 14: Page has a submit button
         - Validate the existence of a submit button within the contact form.

4. Test Environment

   - Environment:
     - Utilize a testing environment equipped with Selenium WebDriver, Mocha framework, Chai assertion library, and Node.js for executing automated UI tests.

5. Execution and Reporting

   - Execution:
     - Execute the test cases using Mocha framework integrated with Selenium WebDriver to interact with and validate the contact page's UI components.
   - Reporting:
     - Utilize Mocha Reporter to log test results, including the pass/fail status, in a structured format for analysis and debugging.

6. Schedule

   - Timeline:
     - Conduct UI testing parallel to the development phase, ensuring continuous integration with each build and pre-release testing before major deployments.
